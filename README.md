## The Job Can Wait  

Serious industries present to you: You will not get tasks that would require you to venture North before disabling Miracle Machine and Brain Scorcher.

## Exceptions
You play as any of the following faction:
- Monolith
- UNISG
- SIN
- Zombified

You have "Story mode" ticked off.

## Tasks included
All vanilla anomaly tasks are accounted for (in theory)
- Bounty
- Spy extraction
- Assault
- Bounty
- Anomaly measurement?!

## Installation
Since this is a BETA the mod overwrites a couple of stuff. In the future I will minimize this.
For now just chuck it at max prio.
